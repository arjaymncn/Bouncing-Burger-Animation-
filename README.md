# Bouncing-Burger-Animation-
Bouncing Burger

By arjay manucan

This is my little Python project where a burger image bounces around the screen with my name on it ,  Every time the burger hits the edge, my name changes color. You can pause and resume the animation by pressing the spacebar.
 How to Run it?
1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.
2. Install Pillow if you haven't already:
   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```
3. Place your burger image as `joshua.jpg` in the same folder as the script.
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python bouncing_burger.py
   ```

Enjoy watching the burger bounce around with my name in style!
