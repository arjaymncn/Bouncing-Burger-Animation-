# Bouncing-Burger-Animation-
Bouncing Burger

I created this project using Python and Tkinter to explore animation and GUI development. The program opens a window with a fixed-size canvas where a burger image, with my name Arjay Manucan displayed at the center, bounces smoothly around the screen.
Each time the burger hits a window edge, it reverses direction and the color of my name changes randomly. I used create_image and create_text to display the image and text, and controlled the motion with after to simulate frame-by-frame animation at about 60 FPS.

To add interactivity, I implemented a pause/resume feature using the spacebar, handled with bind

The project demonstrates real-time movement, collision detection, and dynamic UI updates.

This project helped me understand how to create smooth animations and manage user interaction in Tkinter, and it was a fun way to combine logic, creativity, and programming skills.
